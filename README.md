# Audio-Input-PCMI2S

I2S (Inter-IC Sound) is a serial, synchronous communication protocol that is usually used for transmitting audio data between two digital audio devices. ESP32 contains two I2S peripheral(s). These peripherals can be configured to input and output sample data via the I2S driver.

The complete script which used for programming can be found at
